<H1>Compiled Lisp : Some Points</H1>
<p align=right><A HREF="lisp.html">home</A>
<p align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes back I put a question on <A HREF="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&group=comp.lang.lisp">comp.lang.lisp</A> about the nature of compiled lisp.  As I knew CMUCL was supposed to compile to native machine code.  So does gcc with C code.  The question, then, was to why is that people claimed that Lisp was slower than C.  I wanted to know what is fundamentally different in the way both the compilers compile.
<p align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I received excellent answers and examples about this query.  In my sincere effort to contribute to the Lisp community (for the benefit of the new comers like me) I decided to compile (grin) all that wisdom this page.  I cannot contribute in any other way as I too am a beginner and that too a part-timer.

<p align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion is that Lisp compilers <b>*can*</b> produce machine code comparable to the one produced by a C compiler.  However it requires optimizations which can be used wherever speed is critical.  The standard Lisp code has a number of safety checks which make fast high level programming possible.  So to develop equivalent applications in C takes <b>*much*</b> longer than in Lisp.  And you can use small part of the saved time to optimise the Lisp code to run almost as fast or faster than the C code.  Also some Lisp compilers allow inline assembly for further optimizations if so required.

<p align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know there will be some who claim what's with all this speed crazy ness.  But if speed is *one* of the strengths of Lisp than why allow misinformation about it?  According to the explanations I got, seems like CL can beat the shit out of Java/C++ in runtime performance.  And C++ is often used for performance.

[...]HOWEVER, it is can be quite difficult to write `the same' code in Lisp and in C.  To give a very<br>small example, suppose you wrote function foo that `simply' added two numbers:

<span style="color:olive">int foo (int left, int right)
{
  return left + right;
}
</span><span style="color:red">
(defun foo (left right)
  (+ left right))
</span>
The C code compiles to this:
<span style="color:green">
  push        ebp  
  mov         ebp,esp 
  mov         eax,dword ptr [right] 
  mov         ecx,dword ptr [left] 
  add         eax,ecx 
  pop         ebp  
  ret
</span>
And the Lisp code compiles to this:
<span style="color:green">
  push    ebp
  mov     ebp,esp
  push    edi
  cmp     ecx,00002h
  je      000F
  call    near dword ptr [esi+0000010BCh]
  push    dword ptr [ebp+0000Ch]
  mov     eax,[ebp+00008h]
  pop     edx
  test    al,007h
  jne     0025
  test    dl,007h
  jne     0025
  add     eax,edx
  jno     002B
  sub     eax,edx
  call    near dword ptr [esi+0000017FCh]
  mov     ecx,0001
  mov     esp,ebp
  pop     ebp
  ret
</span>
These are clearly different.  The reason is that although the C and the Lisp code superficially<br> resemble one another, the Lisp code is doing far more work.  These instructions:
<span style="color:green">
  cmp     ecx,00002h
  je      000F
  call    near dword ptr [esi+0000010BCh]
</span>
ensure that FOO is invoked with exactly two arguments.  The C code doesn't bother to check.

These instructions:
<span style="color:green">
  test    al,007h
  jne     0025
  test    dl,007h
  jne     0025
</span>
check whether both the arguments are fixnums.  If they are not, the out-of-line addition<br> operation is called.

This instruction:
<span style="color:green">
  jno     002B
</span>
checks that the result did not overflow.

Finally this instruction:
<span style="color:green">
  mov     ecx,0001
</span>
notifies the caller that a single value is being returned.

The lisp code
<span style="color:red">
(defun foo (left right)
  (+ left right))
</span>
is closer to this C code:
<span style="color:olive">
Object * foo (int argcount, Object * left, Object * right)
{
    register int result;

    if (argcount != 2)
        wrong_number_of_arguments ();

    return (((char) left) == FIXNUM_CODE 
             && ((char) right) == FIXNUM_CODE
             && (result = left + right, 
                  __no_overflow()))   // assume some sort of intrinsic
           ? result
           : generic_add (left, right);
}
</span>
It is pretty hard to write safe, generic code in C.

But if you really want to, you often can tell your Lisp compiler to
omit many security checks.  For instance, in Lispworks you get

CL-USER 35 ><span style="color:red"> (defun foo (left right)
               (declare (optimize speed (safety 0) (debug 0)
                                  (space 0) (compilation-speed 0))
                        (fixnum left right))
               (the fixnum (+ left right)))</span>

This is actually pretty bad compilation - it is not tail-merging and
is using stack for no good reason.  I suspect that
if you use a -O option on whatever C compiler you are using,
you will get better code.

Also, I understand that the point of your post was to show how
difficult it was to do generic coding in C, but also it is
important to know how easy it is to do fast programming in lisp -
the same example with a few declarations can be as fast or faster
than the C version.  In Allegro CL:

CL-USER(9):<span style="color:red"> (compile (defun foo (left right)
                       (declare (optimize speed (safety 0) (debug 0))
                                (fixnum left right))
                       (+ left right)))</span>
FOO
NIL
NIL
CL-USER(10): (disassemble 'foo)<span style="color:green">
;; disassembly of #<Function FOO>
;; formals: LEFT RIGHT

;; code start: #x714980a4:
   0: 03 c2       addl	eax,edx
   2: f8          clc
   3: 8b 75 fc    movl	esi,[ebp-4]
   6: c3          ret
   7: 90          nop</span>
CL-USER(11): 

The extra nop is included in the code vector for alignment purposes
only and has no bearing on execution.
