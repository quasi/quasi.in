You tell them they don't have to run 
We're gonna pick up everyone 
Come out and take me by my hand 
Gonna bury all our troubles in the sand, oh yeah
Can't you see the wonder at your feet 
Your life's complete 
Follow me down 
Can't you see me growing, get your guns 
The time has come 
To follow me down
Follow me across the sea 
Where milky babies seem to be 
Molded, flowing revelry 
With the one that set them free
Tell all the people that you see 
It's just me 
Follow me down

Now, I'm gonna love you 
Till the heavens stop the rain

<PRE>There will never be 
Another one like you 
There will never be 
Another one who can 
Do the things you do, oh
Will you give another chance? 
Will you try, little try? 
Please stop and you remember 
We were together, anyway, all right
And if you have a certain evenin' 
You could lend to me 
I'd give it all right back to you 
A how it has to be with you 
I know your moves and your mind 
And your mind 
And your mind 
And your mind 
And your mind 
And your mind 
And your mind
Will you stop and think and wonder? 
Just what you'll see 
Out on the train yard 
Nursin' penitentiary 
It's gone, I cry out long
Go head, brother
Did you stop it to consider? 
How it will feel 
Cold, grinded grizzly bear jaws 
Hot on your heels
Do you often stop and whisper? 
It's Saturday's shore 
The whole world's a savior 
Who could ever, ever, ever 
Ever, ever, ever 
Ask for more?
Do you remember? 
Will you stop? 
Will you stop? 
The pain
And there will never be 
Another one like you 
There will never be 
Another one who can 
Do the things you do, oh
Will you give another chance? 
Will you try, little try? 
Please stop and you remember 
We were together, anyway, all right
How you must of think and wondered 
How I must feel 
Out on the meadows 
While you run the field 
I'm alone for you 
And I cry
The sweat, look at it 
Optical promise 
Heh, heh, heh 
You'll be dead and in hell 
Before I'm born 
Sure thing 
Brides maid 
The only solution 
Isn't it amazing?

<PRE>All right
Wild child full of grace 
Savior of the human race 
Your cool face
Natural child, terrible child 
Not your mother's or your father's child 
Your our child, screamin' wild
An ancient rulage of grains 
And the trees of the night 
Ha, ha, ha, ha
With hunger at her heels 
Freedom in her eyes 
She dances on her knees 
Pirate prince at her side 
Stirrin' into a hollow idols eyes
Wild child full of grace 
Savior of the human race 
Your cool face 
Your cool face 
Your cool face
Do you remember when we were in Africa?

Left me here to sing his song 
Pretty little girl with the red dress on 
Poor Otis dead and gone
Yeah, back down, turn around slowly 
Try it again, remembering when 
It was easy, try it again 
Much to easy, rememberin' when
All right, look at my shoes 
Not quite the walkin' blues 
Don't fight, too much to lose 
Can't fight the runnin' blues
Well, I've got the runnin' blues 
Runnin' away, back to L.A. 
Got to find the dock of the bay 
Maybe find it back in L.A.
Runnin' scared 
Runnin' blue 
Goin' so fast 
What'll I do
Well, I've got the runnin' blues 
Runnin' away, back to L.A. 
Got to find the dock of the bay 
Maybe find it back in L.A.
All right, look at my shoes 
Not quite the walkin' blues 
Don't fight, too much to lose 
Can't fight the runnin' blues

Water covers everything in blue 
Coolin' water
Wishful sinful 
Our love is beautiful to see 
I know where I would like to be 
Right back where I came
Wishful, sinful, wicked blue 
Water covers you 
Wishful, sinful, wicked you 
Can't escape the blue
Magic risin' 
Sun is shinin' deep beneath the sea 
But not enough for you and me and sunshine 
Love to hear the wind cry
Wishful sinful 
Our love is beautiful to see 
I know where I would like to be 
Right back where I came
Wishful, sinful, wicked blue 
Water covers you 
Wishful, sinful, wicked you

<PRE>When I was back there in seminary school 
There was a person there 
Who put forth the proposition 
That you can petition the Lord with prayer 
Petition the lord with prayer 
Petition the lord with prayer 
You cannot petition the lord with prayer!
Can you give me sanctuary 
I must find a place to hide 
A place for me to hide
Can you find me soft asylum 
I can't make it anymore 
The Man is at the door
Peppermint, miniskirts, chocolate candy 
Champion sax and a girl named Sandy 
There's only four ways to get unraveled 
One is to sleep and the other is travel, da da 
One is a bandit up in the hills 
One is to love your neighbor 'till 
His wife gets home
Catacombs 
Nursery bones 
Winter women 
Growing stones 
Carrying babies 
To the river
Streets and shoes 
Avenues 
Leather riders 
Selling news 
The monk bought lunch
Ha ha, he bought a little 
Yes, he did 
Woo! 
This is the best part of the trip 
This is the trip, the best part 
I really like 
What'd he say? 
Yeah! 
Yeah, right! 
Pretty good, huh 
Huh! 
Yeah, I'm proud to be a part of this number
Successful hills are here to stay 
Everything must be this way 
Gentle streets where people play 
Welcome to the Soft Parade
All our lives we sweat and save 
Building for a shallow grave 
Must be something else we say 
Somehow to defend this place 
Everything must be this way 
Everything must be this way, yeah
The Soft Parade has now begun 
Listen to the engines hum 
People out to have some fun 
A cobra on my left 
Leopard on my right, yeah
The deer woman in a silk dress 
Girls with beads around their necks 
Kiss the hunter of the green vest 
Who has wrestled before 
With lions in the night
Out of sight! 
The lights are getting brighter 
The radio is moaning 
Calling to the dogs 
There are still a few animals 
Left out in the yard 
But it's getting harder 
To describe sailors 
To the underfed
Tropic corridor 
Tropic treasure 
What got us this far 
To this mild equator?
We need someone or something new 
Something else to get us through, yeah, c'mon
Callin' on the dogs 
Callin' on the dogs 
Oh, it's gettin' harder 
Callin' on the dogs 
Callin' in the dogs 
Callin' all the dogs 
Callin' on the gods
You gotta meet me 
Too late, baby 
Slay a few animals 
At the crossroads 
Too late 
All in the yard 
But it's gettin' harder 
By the crossroads 
You gotta meet me 
Oh, we're goin', we're goin great 
At the edge of town 
Tropic corridor 
Tropic treasure 
Havin' a good time 
Got to come along 
What got us this far 
To this mild equator? 
Outskirts of the city 
You and I 
We need someone new 
Somethin' new 
Somethin' else to get us through 
Better bring your gun 
Better bring your gun 
Tropic corridor 
Tropic treasure 
We're gonna ride and have some fun
When all else fails 
We can whip the horse's eyes 
And make them sleep 
And cry
