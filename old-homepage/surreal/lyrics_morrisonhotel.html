Keep your eyes on the road, your hands upon the wheel
Yeah, we're goin' to the Roadhouse
We're gonna have a real
Good time
 
Yeah, back at the Roadhouse they got some bungalows
 Yeah, back at the Roadhouse they got some bungalows
And that's for the people
Who like to go down slow
 
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, all night long
 
Do it, honey, do it

You gotta roll, roll, roll
You gotta thrill my soul, all right

Ashen lady, Ashen lady
Give up your vows, give up your vows
Save our city, save our city
Right now
 
Well, I woke up this morning, I got myself a beer
Well, I woke up this morning, and I got myself a beer
The future's uncertain, and the end is always near
 
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, all night long

<B><A name=2>Peace Frog</A></B><BR>
<PRE>There's blood in the streets, it's up to my ankles
She came
There's blood on the streets, it's up to my knee
She came
Blood on the streets in the town of Chicago
She came
Blood on the rise, it's following me
Think about the break of day

She came and then she drove away
Sunlight in her hair

She came
Blood in the streets runs a river of sadness
She came
Blood in the streets it's up to my thigh
She came
Yeah the river runs red down the legs of the city
She came
The women are crying rivers of weepin'

She came into town and then she drove away
Sunlight in her hair

Indians scattered on dawn's highway bleeding
Ghosts crowd the young child's fragile eggshell mind

Blood in the streets in the town of New Haven
Blood stains the roofs and the palm trees of Venice
Blood in my love in the terrible summer
Bloody red sun of Phantastic L.A.

Blood screams the pain as they chop off her fingers
Blood will be born in the birth of a nation
Blood is the rose of mysterious union

There's blood in the streets, it's up to my ankles
Blood in the streets, it's up to my knee
Blood in the streets in the town of Chicago
Blood on the rise, it's following me

<B><A name=3>Queen of the Highway</A></B><BR>
<PRE>She was a princess, Queen of the Highway
Sign on the road said:  "Take us to Madre"
No one could save her, save the blind tiger
He was a monster, black dressed in leather
She was a princess, Queen of the Highway

Now they are wedded, she is a good girl
Naked as children out in a meadow,
Naked as children, wild as can be,
Soon to have offspring, start it all over

Start at all over

American boy, American girl,
Most beautiful people in the world!
Son of a frontier Indian Swirl,
Dancing through the midnight whirl-pool
Formless hope it can
continue a little while longer

<B><A name=4>Blue Sunday</A></B><BR>
<PRE>I found my own true love
Was on a blue Sunday
She looked at me and told me
I was the only one in the world
Now I have found my girl

My girl awaits for me in tender time
My girl is mine
She is the world
She is my girl

My girl awaits for me in tender time
My girl is mine
She is the world
She is my girl

<B><A name=5>Ship Of Fools</A></B><BR>
<PRE>The human race was dying out
No one left to scream and shout
People walking on the moon
Smog will get you pretty soon

Ev'ryone was hangin' out
Hangin' up and hangin' down
Hangin' in and holdin' fast
Hope our little world will last

Along came Mister Goodtrips
Looking for a new ship
Come on, people, better climb on board
Come on, baby, now we're going home

Ship of fools
Ship of fools

The human race was dying out
No one left to scream and shout
People walking on the moon
Smog will get you pretty soon

Ship of fools
Ship of fools
Ship of fools
Ship of fools
Ship of fools
Ship of fools
Ship of fools

Yeah, climb on board
Ship's gonna leave ya far behind
Climb on board

Ship of fools

<B><A name=6>Land Ho!</A></B><BR>
<PRE>Grandma loved a sailed who sailed the frozen sea
Grandpa was that whaler and he took me on his knee
He said, "Son, I'm goin' crazy from livin' on the land
Got to find my shipmates and walk on foreign sands."

This old man was graceful, with silver in his smile
He smoked a briar pipe and he walked for country miles
Singing songs of shady sisters and old time liberty
Song of love and songs of death and songs to set men free

I've got three ships and sixty men
A course for ports unread
I'll stand at mast, let north winds blow
Till half of us are dead

Land ho!

Well, if I get my hands on a dollar bill
Gonna buy a bottle and drink my fill
If I get my hands on a number five
Gonna skin that little girl alive

If I get my hands on a number two
Come back home and marry you
Marry you
Marry you
All right

Yeah, land ho
Yeah, land ho
Well, if I get back home
And I feel all right
You know I'm gonna love you tonight
Love tonight
Love tonight
Yeah, land ho!

Really need you, baby

<PRE>Miss Maggie M'Gill she lived on a hill
Her daddy got drunk and left her no will
So she went down, down to "Tangie Town"
People down there really like to get it on

Now, if you're sad and you're feelin' blue
Go out and buy a brand new pair of shoes
And you go down, down to "Tangie Town"
The people down there really like to get it on
Get it on

Illegitimate son of a rock and roll star
Illegitimate son of a rock and roll star
Mom met Dad in the back of a rock 'n' roll car

I've been singing the blues ever since the world began

<B><A name=11>Waiting For The Sun</A></B><BR>
<PRE>At first flash of Eden we raced down to the sea
Standing there on freedom's shore

Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun

Can't you feel it, now that spring has come
That it's time to live in the scattered sun

Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting...

Waiting for you to come along
Waiting for you to hear my song
Waiting for you to come along
Waiting for you to tell me what went wrong

This is the strangest life I've ever known

Can't you feel it, now that spring has come
That it's time to live in the scattered sun

Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
</PRE>
