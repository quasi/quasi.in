<h4>Photographing</h4>

<p align=justify>I love photographing.  I have always been like this.  The facination of capturing an image of this world we live in, of capturing a moment of time forever... aaah.  Almost orgasmic.  But photography is a very expensive hobby where I live.  So we do not burn as much film as some other folks around the world.  But the challenge, then, is to make use of every frame you click.  Think.  Think. And then think some more before you click.  Since the arriaval of the digital, I have clicked far more than I had clicked in all the years before.  Digital is good.  It is here to stay.  I love my <span class=equip>S414</span>.  But the <span class=equip>5</span> is something else.  The <span class="equip">50/1.4</span> is something else.  I just wish I had the money to buy the 7D when it will come out.  Minolta did a great thing to make it take all the existing AF lenses.

<div class="photo-left"><img src="images/th-mainpage-boats.jpg" height="100" width="200"><div class="caption">Boats at bhau-cha-dhakka</div></div>I have dabbled in some portrait photography.  I found that even though initially I hated to photograph humans, soon I did not.  I felt it a challenge and an interesting experience to try to capture the spirit of the person.  That is to try and portray in the photograph what and how the person seems to me.  Am still very raw -- but at least I tried.  Some of my <a rel="me"  href="photography_portraits_bw.html">B&amp;W Portraits</a> and some <a href="photography_portraits_col.html">Color Portraits</a> too.

<p align=justify>I have also tried some <a href="photography_flowers.html">Flower</a> photography.  But it was a hasty and ill thought out experiment with all the wrong equipment <I>always</I>.  The photographs are extremely amaturish but then hey... at least I tried. <br><br>

<h4>Equipment</h4>

<div class="photo-right"><IMG SRC="images/th-mainpage-leaves-th02.jpg" WIDTH="220" HEIGHT="148" BORDER=0><div class="caption">Youth</div></div><p align=justify>I first got to use my dad's <span class=equip>Zenit-E</span> when I was about 13 or 14.  Since then I have known about the aperture and the shutter at all such things.  I was lucky.  I 'E' came into my possession when I was about 19.  The <span class=equip>Zenit-E</span> comes with a very sharp <span class=equip>Helios-44 MF 58mm f:2 (M42) &oslash;49</span>.  I used it till I got my <span class=equip>Minolta Dynax 5</span> in Dec 2002.  In between I used our family <span class=equip>Minolta Riva 35ST</span> compact for my trekking and other outings.  The 'E' was too heavy and unreliable.
<br><BR>
Ever since I have had it, the '5' has become my favourite.  It is a fantastic camera and for the money I paid for it, there was no competition.  It is extremely light (~400grams) and yet feels solid.  The <span class=equip>Minolta AF 28-80mm f:3.5-5.6 D MACRO &oslash;55</span> which came with it is also very light and mated perfectly to the '5'.  I have to use of my friend Himanshu's <span class=equip>Minolta AF 100-200mm f:4.5 &oslash;49</span>.  This lens has given me good results for portraits and otherwise.  I was also lucky to buy a second hand <span class=equip>Minolta AF 50mm f:1.4 &oslash;49</span> from Linda Swope in the US.  This is an excellent piece of glass and is now my favourate lens.  My friend Dukku has <div class="photo-left"><IMG SRC="images/th-mainpage-panorama-irshal-th03.jpg" WIDTH="276" HEIGHT="100" BORDER=0><div class="caption">Irshalgad</div></div>presented me with the <span class=equip>Tamron AF 200-400mm f:5.6 LD &oslash;77</span> this May.  I still have to get it though... <br><br>I got my digital <span class=equip>Minolta DImage S414</span> <A HREF="http://www.steves-digicams.com/2003_reviews/s414.html"><i>(review)</i></A> in Oct '03.  Since then I have done quite some experimentation with it.
<BR><BR>
I generally have a <span class=equip>Spik U/V &oslash;49</span> filter on the 50mm and the <span class=equip>Marumi U/V &oslash;55</span> on the 28-80.  I have a <div class="photo-right"><IMG SRC="images/th-mainpage-geezee-at-night-th01.jpg" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="150" BORDER=0><div class="caption">At Night</div></div><span class=equip>Promaster Cicrular Polarizer &oslash;49</span> for the 50 & the 100-200 and a <span class=equip>HighTech Linear Polarizer &oslash;52 </span>for the 28-80 (with a step down ring).  I have a <span class=equip>Vivitar Tripod VPT-1200</span> which I find OK for use while trekking. It is not very stable, though.
<BR><BR>
I have a very primitive home darkroom where I just have the <span class=equip>KB B/W Enlarger</span> with the <span class=equip>Marumi 50/3.5 Enlarging Lens</span>
<BR><BR>
I also have some old disfunctional cameras like <span class="equip">Afga Standard (1926-1931 vintage) [<a
 href="camera_agfa-standard.html">more</a>]</span>, <span class="equip">Agfa Isoli</span>, <span class="equip">Agfa Click III</span>, <span class="equip">Kodak Hawkeye</span>.
