<PRE>Do you know the warm progress
		under the stars?
Do you know we exist?
Have you forgotten the keys
	to the Kingdom?
Have you been borne yet
		&amp; are you alive?

Let's reinvent the gods, all the myths
			of the ages
Celebrate symbols from deep elder forests
[Have you forgotten the lessons
			of the ancient war]

We need great golden copulations

The fathers are cackling in trees of the forest
Our mother is dead in the sea

Do you know we are being led to
	slaughters by placid admirals
&amp; that fat slow generals are getting
	obscene on young blood

Do you know we are ruled by T.V.
The moon is a dry blood beast
Guerilla bands are rolling numbers
	in the next block of green vine
amassing for warfare on innocent herdsmen
	who are just dying

O great creator of being
grant us one more hour to
	perform our art
	&amp; perfect our lives

The moths &amp; atheists are doubly divine
	&amp; dying
We live, we die
&amp; death not ends it
Journey we more into the
	Nightmare
Cling to life
	our passion'd flower
Cling to cunts &amp; cocks
	of despair
We got our final vision
	by clap
Columbus' groin got
	filled w/ green death
	(I touched her thigh
		&amp; death smiled)

We have assembled inside this ancient
	&amp; insane theatre
To propagate our lust for life
	&amp; flee the swarming wisdom
			of the streets
The barns are stormed
The windows kept
&amp; only one of all the rest
To dance &amp; save us
W/ the divine mockery
	of words
Music inflames temperament

	(When the true King's murderers
	 are allowed to roam free
	 a 1000 magicians arise
	   in the land)

Where are the feasts
	we were promised
Where is the wine
	The New Wine
		(dying on the vine)

resident mockery
give us an hour for magic
We of the purple glove
We of the starling flight
&amp; velvet hour
We of arabic pleasure's breed
We of sundome &amp; the night

Give us a creed
To believe
A night of Lust
Give us trust in
The Night

Give of color
hundred hues
a rich Mandala
for me &amp; you

&amp; for your silky
pillowed house
a head, wisdom
&amp; a bed

Troubled decree
Resident mockery
has claimed thee

We used to believe
in the good old days
We still receive
In little ways

The Things of Kindness
&amp; unsporting brow
Forget &amp; allow

Did you know freedom exists
	in a school book
Did you know madmen are
	running our prison
w/in a jail, w/in a gaol
w/in a white free protestant
Maelstrom

We're perched headlong
	on the edge of boredom
We're reaching for death
	on the end of a candle
We're trying for something
	That's already found us

We can invent Kingdoms of our own
grand purple thrones, those chairs of lust
&amp; love we must, in beds of rust

Steel doors lock in prisoner's screams
&amp; muzak, AM, rocks their dreams
No black men's pride to hoist the beams
while mocking angels sift what seems

To be a collage of magazine dust
Scratched on foreheads of walls of trust
This is just jail for those who must
get up in the morning &amp; fight for such

unusable standards
while weeping maidens
show-off penury &amp; pout
ravings for a mad
staff

Wow, I'm sick of doubt
Live in the light of certain
South

Cruel bindings
The servants have the power
dog-men &amp; their mean women
pulling poor blankets over
our sailors
(&amp; where were you in our
	lean hour)
Milking your moustache?
or grinding a flower?
I'm sick of dour faces
Staring at me from the T.V.
Tower. I want roses in
my garden bower;  dig?
Royal babies, rubies
must now replace aborted
Strangers in the mud
These mutants, blood-meal
for the plant that's plowed

They are waiting to take us into
			the severed garden
Do you know how pale &amp; wanton thrillful
	comes death on strange hour
	unannounced, unplanned for
like a scaring over-friendly guest you've
	brought to bed
Death makes angels of us all
	&amp; gives us wings
where we had shoulders
	smooth as raven's
		claws

No more money, no more fancy dress
This other Kingdom seems by far the best
until its other jaw reveals incest
&amp; loose obedience to a vegetable law

I will not go
Prefer a Feast of Friends
To the Giant family

<PRE>Great screaming Christ
Upsy-daisy
Lazy Mary will get you up
upon a Sunday morning

"The movie will begin in 5 moments"
The mindless Voice announced
"All those unseated, will await
The next show"

We filed slowly, languidly
into the hall. The auditorium
was vast, &amp; silent.
As we seated &amp; were darkened
The Voice continued:

"The program for this evening
is not new. You have seen
This entertainment thru &amp; thru.
You've seen your birth, your
life &amp; death; you might recall
all of the rest -- (did you
have a good world when you
died?) -- enough to base
a movie on?"

An iron chuckle rapped our
minds like a fist.

I'm getting out of here
Where're you going?
To the other side of the morning
Please don't chase the clouds
pagodas, temples

Her cunt gripped him
like a warm friendly
hand.

"It's all right.
All your friends are here."

When can I meet them?
"After you've eaten"
I'm not hungry
"O, we meant beaten"

Silver stream, silvery scream,
impossible concentration

Here come the comedians
look at them smile
Watch them dance
an indian mile

Look at them gesture
How aplomb
So to gesture everyone

Words dissemble
Words be quick
Words resemble walking sticks

Plant them
They will grow
Watch them waver so

I'll always be
a word-man
Better than a birdman

But I'll charge
Won't get away
w/out lodging a dollar

Shall I say it again
aloud, you get the point
No food w/out fuel's gain

I'll be, the irish loud
unleashed my beak
at peak of powers

O girl, unleash
your worried comb

O worried mind

Sin in the fallen
Backwoods by the blind

She smells debt
on my new collar

Arrogant prose
Tied in a network of fast quest
Hence the obsession

Its quick to admit
Fats borrowed rhythm
Woman came between them

Women of the world unite
Make the world safe
For a scandalous life

Hee Heee
Cut your throat
Life is a joke

Your wife's in a moat
The same boat
Here comes the goat

Blood Blood Blood Blood
They're making a joke
of our universe

Are you more real than me

<PRE>A hot sick lava flowed up,
Rustling &amp; bubbling.
The paper-face.
Mirror-mask, I love you mirror.

He had been brainwashed for 4 hrs.
The LT. puzzled in again
	"ready to talk"
"No sir" -- was all he'd say.
		Go back to the gym.
		Very peaceful
		Meditation

Air base in the desert
looking out venetian blinds
a plane
a desert flower
cool cartoon

The rest of the World
is reckless &amp; dangerous
Look at the
brothels
Stag films
Exploration
