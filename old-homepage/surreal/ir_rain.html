it is raining again. <BR>
it is 1830hrs. <BR>
the sky is a liquid gray - like an upturned sea. <BR>
the vapours of the city combined with the minute liquid droplets in the air have formed some kind of haze. <BR>
like some kind of cataract I have suddenly developed... <BR>
so thick that I can feel it moving against me when I walk. <BR>
through this haze I see someone coming towards me. <BR>
indistinct yet familiar. <BR>
it is the neighborhood kid in a transparent pink raincoat. <BR>
we both give each other a quiet stare as we pass... <BR>
the haze a thin curtain between us. <BR>
I turn right and come to the wide road. <BR>
It is clean and shiny, reflecting the newly lit mercury vapour lamps. <BR>
The rain always makes me feel lonely, yet distinctly a part of this world.<BR> 
I appear to slow down as the world passes by. <BR>
Then I think how lucky I am. <BR>
I have time. <BR>
Time to observe and to enjoy. <BR>
Look at the frog emerge from one side of the road and wait till it hops it's way to the other side. <BR>
Wait at the bus stop and see the different people in the brightly light windows. <BR>
All staring with unseeing eyes into a different world. home maybe? <BR>
I walk on. <BR>
It is still raining. <BR>
I come to a broken down stone bench and I remember her. <BR>
I turn around and start walking back to the world I belong. <BR>
The rain has stopped. <BR>
All that remains are the big drops under the trees. <BR>
For no apparent reason the frog is again crossing the road. <BR>
