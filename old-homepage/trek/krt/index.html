<P align=justify>Mama and me had been discussing the Konkan biking trip on and off.  We finally decided we would go after our Part I exams. We asked Raju (Chota Father) if he was interested and also Sujay Bhosle.  Dinesh was thinking of coming but had some leave problems from work.  We had some prolonged discussions on which and how many bikes to take.  Finally it was settled that we take my Yamaha Enticer (125cc) and Amey's TVS Victor (110cc).  Then came the planning of the trip.  We did it in between the exams.  Our exams ended 16th May and we were slated to leave early 18th May.  Only one and half free days to do the real packing.</p>
