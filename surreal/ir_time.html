<BODY>
<p>Time: the essence of life.  If we think there is too less of it, we may end up not savouring in it enough.  If we think there is too much of it we may end up not paying any attention to its passage.

<p>The key seems to be in being aware of every moment.  But not being so engulfed in it so as to not see it and not being so distant from it so as to not feel it.
