<BODY>
<p>...maybe the bus deisel had something to do with all this, as its drone has a mesmerising quality in it.  Sometimes, I feel we should have given Mr. Deisel a Nobel prize or something for his contribution to entertainment.  Because there have been many occasions where the time has passed and passed well for me due to the deisel.
<p>It mesmerises me and makes me think of things which I would normally not.  Sometimes it is the rough roar of the 1st which energises me, or sometimes it is the deep drone of the 4th which puts me a contemplative mood.  Sometimes I get dragged down dark allies like going up a hill in the 4th - then I fight back like the scream of the 2nd and then finally the exalting wine of the 3rd going down the other side of the hill!
