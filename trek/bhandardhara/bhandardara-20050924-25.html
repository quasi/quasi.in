<p>Waterfall's galore on the Malsej Ghat.  The twisty-turny road unveiled a white cascade every few minutes towards the top. The clouds tried to deepen the mystery by shrouding us with a clammy white blanket.

<p>The <I>Pimpalgaon</I> dam waters.  We had some hot tea here, and a chat with some degaged villagers.  The waters are this near the village every year, they said - whatever the amount of rain.  It figures, as this is a highland region.  The excess will flow down ...

<p>We reached Bhandardara in the afternoon.  But the weather was so enchanting that we all relaxed completely till evening.  This is the view from our room (evening).

<p>Dinesh, of the party, with the guitar.  We had fun in the night with some crazy singing by him and amazing guitaring by Guru Raju.

<p>The ladies of the party had tremendous enthusiasm.  They got up early in the chill of morning to take in the place while we were in cozy slumber.

<p>Five of the party, after breakfast.  There was a dog which wanted so much to be part of the picture.  I barely managed to miss him with this shot.

<p>The Willson dam. The lake formed is called Arthur Lake (I think).

<div class=figure>
<IMG SRC="00770018-w.jpg" WIDTH="500" HEIGHT="331" BORDER=0 ALT="">
<p>This is a place where we were at a point lower than the top of the dam wall.  The waters were overflowing and it a was moving sight to see the immense quantity of water at your eye level.

<div class=figure>

<p>We had to go through about a foot of flowing water.  Fun.

<p>Four of the party.  The edge at the randha side was protected by grills.  The watchman was a crazy old man who liked to blow his whistle and banish his stick.  The was especially interested in me as I went off track (no pun) as usual.

<p>From a bit further up.  There was a ya-hoom local school visit at the falls.  I had to compete with lots of excited kids to get to the grill.

<p>There was another waterfall on the other side of the V which joined the main randha falls runoff.  It fell in a deep gorge, I believe.  But my attempts to get there were nipped in the bud by the whistle-blowing-stick-banishing watchman. Sigh.
